TypeScript enables JavaScript to scale.\r\n                            When working with a codebase at that level with various teams and many \r\n                            moving parts, the type-checking feature TypeScript provides ensures your \r\n                            code works exactly like you intend it to when you type it. Type-checking \r\n                            provides you and everyone else a peace of mind whenever code is pushed. And all this \r\n                            talk is not without proof, Airbnb reported 38% of bugs in its frontend \r\n                            codebase could have been preventable with TypeScript according to the \r\n                            company's postmortem analysis. \r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p>\r\n                            I've always been a programmer who prefers dynamically typed languages, which \r\n                            is why JavaScript and Python are my most beloved languages. But after \r\n                            learning about how TypeScript has prevented numerous headaches by catching \r\n                            code mistakes right when you type it, rather than having to deal with linking \r\n                            peices of code to a bug five files away, I decided to give this statically typed \r\n                            language a try. I've just explained why I decided to migrate and add TypeScript \r\n                            support to my codebase, let's move onto how.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p>\r\n                            When I began this project of developing my site, create-react-app (CRA) was where I went \r\n                            for my React ecosystem setup. (If you're starting out, I'll recommend taking a look \r\n                            into Next.js - it's a brilliant framework on top of React that provides \r\n                            server-side rendering as well.) \r\n                            When I first started thinking about migrating to TypeScript, I thought it would be \r\n                            a major headache. CRA bootstraps everything up for you, therefore saving you the trouble of \r\n                            configuration, but that also means less control and customization. You can't modify your \r\n                            webpack.config.json for example, since it's been preconfigured. The \r\n                            alternative is to eject which doesn't sound like the best idea. So there's a problem: \r\n                            you need to reconfigure webpack to compile TypeScript into JavaScript for your bundles. \r\n                            Several others have found ways \r\n                            around this, by using custum plugins like CopyWebpackPlugin and react-scripts-ts. \r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p>\r\n                            With the realease of react-scripts v2.1.0, CRA now natively supports TypeScript, which give me \r\n                            a major sigh of relief. The first step is to add the following modules.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p>\r\n                            <code>\r\n                                yarn add -D typescript @types/node @types/react @types/react-dom @types/jest\r\n                            </code> \r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p>\r\n                            I then proceeded to rename the extensions of all my react files to <code>.tsx</code>, which \r\n                            should throw out a load of errors. I recommend doing this one file at a time. Fix the errors,\r\n                            add @type definition dependencies as you need them, and move onto the next file. When you have one file \r\n                            migrated to TypeScript I suggest running the frontend server to make sure everything still works. \r\n                            If successful, there should be a <code>react-app-env.d.ts</code> file in <code>src/</code> and \r\n                            a <code>tsconfig.json</code> file in <code>root/</code>. \r\n                            These files are responsible for compiling TS into JavaScript. \r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p>\r\n                            I'll note that it's also a good idea to create a <code>declare_modules.d.ts</code> file in \r\n                            <code> src/</code>. Declare modules in the file when a @type definition for a dependency doesn't \r\n                            exist. And for this to work, you'll need add a line to <code>tsconfig.json</code>.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p>\r\n                            <code>\r\n                                \"typeRoots\": [\"./src/declare_modules\", \"node_modules/@types\"]\r\n                            </code>\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p>\r\n                            Your file(s) sould look like this:\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <ReactEmbedGist gist='Winggo/0e2ce1b9d9749b2a319620a5d860ba7a' />\r\n                        <ReactEmbedGist gist='Winggo/6bc59c9eb1b03876522ca5ff3659032d' />\r\n                        <p>\r\n                            This ensures the TypeScript compiler access to the @types definitions. And lastly, \r\n                            an error that kept happening to me when I change file extensions to <code>.tsx</code> is \r\n                            <code> ENOENT: no such file or directory when importing</code>. This happens because \r\n                            I essentially deleted the JS file and created a TSX file, so the app can no longer find \r\n                            the JS file it needed. I fixed this by \r\n                            revisiting the import lines and restarting the React server. Hope that saves you a bit of headache. \r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p>\r\n                            This process took a bit of time setting up, but now I know a whole lot more about type \r\n                            definitions and maintaing cleaner code. Now when I open up a file and look at a function, I \r\n                            know exactly what it takes in and puts out. I can find all my answers in my IDE and compiler. \r\n                            Here's to a more efficient workflow.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                </Fade>\r\n\r\n                <Fade>\r\n                    <Footer content='Happy TypeScripting.'/>\r\n                </Fade>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </Container>\r\n    );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default MigrationBlog;","// extracted by mini-css-extract-plugin\nmodule.exports = {\"page\":\"blogs_page__3IXNm\",\"picContainer\":\"blogs_picContainer__5v3o9\",\"frontPic\":\"blogs_frontPic__3D8AV\",\"content\":\"blogs_content__2GlGU\",\"next\":\"blogs_next__2hXz4\"};","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/tsx.dcb13240.png\";"],"sourceRoot":""}
